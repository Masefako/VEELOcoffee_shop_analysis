INTRODUCTION

As a Junior Data Analyst,I have been provided with a dataset which captured daily transactions from a coffee shop.  The business has recently appointed a new CEO whose mission is to grow the company's revenue and improve products`s performance. My role is to extract actionable insights from historical data and prepare a presentation to assist the CEO to make informed business decisions. 

1. Objectives:
To determine which products generate the most revenue.
To identify the period where the store performs best.
To identify Sale trends across products and time intervals.
To channel more resources to best perfoming products.

2. Data Collection:
Data is saved on MS Excel with CSV format, Data time frame is 6 months for sufficient trend analysis. Dataset Includes product id,unit price,quantity, date/time,product category/type/detail, and store location.

3. Data Preparation:
I used Miro for my flowcharts and planning.
I used Snowflake to query my data i.e Counted number of units sold,counted number of transactions per store location,Multiplied unit price by quantity to get revenue and Grouped dates into months for monthly analysis and daytime for time bucket.

4. Data Analysis:
I used Excel to create pivot tables and Analyze revenue by product category, Identify peak time intervals for sales, Identify best selling product(s) and Perform trend analysis to detect seasonal patterns.

5. Data Visualization:
I used Excel to Develop clear visualizations (charts, graphs, dashboards) to highlight my insights. Line charts for sales trends over product category. Bar charts for store location comparisons over 6 months. Doughnut chart for time bucket contributions.

Summary:
findings with a focus on actionable recommendations, such as:
Bright coffee shop can Adjust inventory based on top-selling items i.e Plan on promotions during off-peak times, make promotions like buy 1 get 1 free in the afternoon/evening OR Bright coffee shop can choose a day during January/March where sales are low and make specials like buy a coffee and get 25% off from ( products thatâ€™s low on sales).
